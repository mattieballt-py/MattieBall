            <p><em>So I started with what I actually knew: HTML and CSS.</em></p>

            <p>Is it just me, or is AI sometimes... not that helpful?</p>

            <p>I've been working on a simple landing page to showcase my engineering portfolio â€” something clean, to help me get freelance clients for mechanical engineering projects. So naturally, I thought: <strong>why not use AI?</strong></p>

            <p>Everyone talks about how easy it is now. I keep seeing posts about 3-year-olds (okay, maybe not literally) launching entire businesses with tools like Lovable, Cursor, or ChatGPT. Just type a prompt, and boom â€” site shipped, product launched, SaaS money rolling in.</p>

            <p>I thought I could do the same.</p>

            <h2>When AI Feels Like a Shortcut You Can't Take</h2>

            <p>Lovable generated a working site in seconds â€” it was kind of magical.</p>

            <p>Until I opened the code.</p>

            <p>Suddenly I was looking at pages of TypeScript, Vite config files, API handlers, edge functions... and I realized I had no idea what any of it actually did. Trying to customize it was like trying to read a book in a language I didn't speak. Every time I changed one thing, something else broke.</p>

            <p>So I spent hours trying to <strong>understand</strong> what AI had made for me â€” instead of actually building something <em>I</em> understood.</p>

            <blockquote>AI wasn't helping. It was hiding the learning I needed to do.</blockquote>

            <h2>Back to Basics</h2>

            <p>So I gave up.</p>

            <p>Not on the site â€” but on the AI.</p>

            <p>I opened a blank <code>.html</code> file and <code>.css</code> file and started from scratch.</p>

            <p>No React. No frameworks. No backend. No AI.</p>

            <p>Just the stuff I actually knew. Headings. Buttons. Margins. Flexbox. I slowly built a static portfolio site by hand â€” understanding every single line of code along the way.</p>

            <p>And you know what?</p>

            <p>It wasn't impressive. It wasn't "AI startup founder in San Francisco" energy. But it was <strong>mine</strong>. And it worked.</p>

            <p>It wasn't fast, but it was real progress.</p>

            <h2>Learning â‰  Speed</h2>

            <p>The irony?</p>

            <p>Everyone says AI is a productivity tool. But for me, it became a distraction â€” because I was trying to speed through skills I hadn't built yet.</p>

            <blockquote>There's nothing wrong with using AI. But if you don't understand the foundations â€” if you're still learning how websites work â€” it won't feel like a shortcut. It'll feel like a wall.</blockquote>

            <p><strong>Sometimes, the slow path <em>is</em> the shortcut.</strong></p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>If you're new, AI can't replace actual understanding.</li>
              <li>If you're stuck, stripping everything back helps.</li>
              <li>A basic site you understand is better than a fancy one you can't edit.</li>
              <li>You're not behind. You're building something real â€” and that counts.</li>
