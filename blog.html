            <p>Is it just me, or is AI sometimes... not that helpful?

              Iâ€™ve been working on a simple landing page to showcase my engineering portfolio â€” something clean, to help me get freelance clients for mechanical engineering projects. So naturally, I thought: why not use AI?
              
              Everyone talks about how easy it is now. I keep seeing posts about 3-year-olds (okay, maybe not literally) launching entire businesses with tools like Lovable, Cursor, or ChatGPT. Just type a prompt, and boom â€” site shipped, product launched, SaaS money rolling in.
              
              I thought I could do the same.
              
              But the reality?
              Lovable generated a working site in seconds â€” it was kind of magical.

Until I opened the code.

Suddenly I was looking at pages of TypeScript, Vite config files, API handlers, edge functions... and I realized I had no idea what any of it actually did. Trying to customize it was like trying to read a book in a language I didnâ€™t speak. Every time I changed one thing, something else broke.

So I spent hours trying to understand what AI had made for me â€” instead of actually building something I understood.

Thatâ€™s when it hit me:
AI wasnâ€™t helping. It was hiding the learning I needed to do.

So I gave up.

Not on the site â€” but on the AI.

I opened a blank .html file and .css file and started from scratch.

No React. No frameworks. No backend. No AI.

Just the stuff I actually knew. Headings. Buttons. Margins. Flexbox. I slowly built a static portfolio site by hand â€” understanding every single line of code along the way.

And you know what?

It wasnâ€™t impressive. It wasnâ€™t "AI startup founder in San Francisco" energy. But it was mine. And it worked.

It wasnâ€™t fast, but it was real progress.

Learning â‰  Speed
The irony?

Everyone says AI is a productivity tool. But for me, it became a distraction â€” because I was trying to speed through skills I hadnâ€™t built yet.

Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with using AI. But if you donâ€™t understand the foundations â€” if youâ€™re still learning how websites work â€” it wonâ€™t feel like a shortcut. Itâ€™ll feel like a wall.

Sometimes, the slow path is the shortcut.

What I Learned
If youâ€™re new, AI canâ€™t replace actual understanding.

If youâ€™re stuck, stripping everything back helps.

A basic site you understand is better than a fancy one you canâ€™t edit.

Youâ€™re not behind. Youâ€™re building something real â€” and that counts.
